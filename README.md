## 📖 Overview

This project uses synthetic data to:

- Predict employee performance scores using **Linear Regression**
- Predict attrition risk using **Random Forest Classifier**
- Visualize prediction accuracy and model interpretability via **SHAP plots**

It serves as a compact demonstration of regression, classification, preprocessing, evaluation, and explainability in a real-world HR scenario.

## Code Overview
➤ Data Generation & Preprocessing
Synthetic dataset created using NumPy

Encoding categorical variables via pd.get_dummies

Feature scaling with StandardScaler

Target variables: Performance Score, Attrition Risk

➤ Regression Model (Linear Regression)
Predicts Performance Score

Evaluated using R² score and Mean Squared Error

Visualized with scatterplot of Actual vs Predicted

➤ Classification Model (Random Forest)
Predicts Attrition Risk

Evaluated using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report

Visualized with seaborn heatmap and confusion matrix plot

➤ SHAP Model Explainability
SHAP values computed on Random Forest model

Summary beeswarm plot shows feature impact on predictions

📊 Results & Visualizations
✅ Performance Score: R² ≈ 0.87, MSE ≈ 90

✅ Attrition Prediction: Balanced precision, recall

🔍 Important Features: Focus Level, Project Delivery Score, Stress Level

📉 Visual Tools: Scatterplots, Confusion Matrix, SHAP Beeswarm

🔮 Future Scope
Integration with HRMS dashboards
