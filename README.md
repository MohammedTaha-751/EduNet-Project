## üìñ Overview

This project simulates a workplace scenario where employee performance is evaluated and attrition is predicted based on features like stress level, focus, work hours, and training. It supports HR analytics by:

- Predicting performance scores using **Linear Regression**
- Classifying attrition risk using **Random Forest Classifier**
- Visualizing feature importance with **SHAP**

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Generate realistic synthetic HR data
- Dual modeling (Regression + Classification)
- Clear performance reports with metrics
- Explainable AI using SHAP visualizations
- Ready for deployment in dashboards

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `shap`
